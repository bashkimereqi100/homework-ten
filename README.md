Team profile generator


Description

The Team Profile Generator is a command-line-input application run in Node that requests information from the user about members of an engineering team and generates an HTML file displaying that information..
Upon launching the app, I'm trying to describe the first member of their team, enters the team member's name, selects that member's role from a list (options include "Engineer," "Intern," and "Manager), enters the member's ID (any string), enters the member's email address, and then must enter another piece of information that will differ depending on what role was selected. If "Engineer" will be  selected, the app asks the user for the team member's GitHub username; if "Intern" will be selected, the member's school is requested; and if "Manager" will be chosen, the user is prompted for the team member's address e-mail.
